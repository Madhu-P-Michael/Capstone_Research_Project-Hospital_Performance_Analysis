Msc Data Science at MAHE, Capstone Research Project: Analyzing Hospital Performance Metrics to Enhance Operational Efficiency and Facilitate Informed Patient Decisions.
# Hospital Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes hospital performance metrics to enhance operational efficiency and facilitate informed patient decisions. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation using both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models.

## Project Structure
- **Hospital-Performance-Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, model building, and results.
- **data/**: Folder containing any datasets used (if you're uploading them, ensure they are publicly shareable).
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Results
R-squared (Random Forest): 0.91
Most Important Features: Data availability in key performance metrics significantly impacts hospital ratings.
Conclusion
Hospitals should prioritize data transparency and focus on improving patient care to achieve better ratings.
